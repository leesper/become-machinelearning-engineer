### 领域背景

“猫狗大战”项目的领域背景是深度学习中的计算机视觉。根据[维基百科](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)的定义，“计算机视觉”是一个交叉学科领域，该领域研究计算机如何对数字图像或者视频产生高层次的理解。它使得计算机模仿人类视觉系统并自动处理相关任务成为可能，例如对象识别，动作追踪，实景再现和图像复原等等。

计算机视觉的发展最早要追溯到20世纪60年代，那个时候世界上一些研究人工智能的大学就已经开展了相关领域的研究，目的是为了赋予智能机器人“看得见”的能力。后来在20世纪70年代进行的相关研究为这一领域奠定了基础，这些成果至今仍被沿用（包括边缘抽取，线段标注，多面体建模，动作估计和通过多个小结构的连接构成的对象表示等等）。20世纪80年代则开展了严格的数学分析和量化研究。到20世纪90年代末，计算机视觉与计算机图形学的交叉研究开始增多。最近几年计算机视觉研究的主流是与机器学习技术（特别是深度学习）和各种复杂优化方法相结合的，基于特征的方法。

本项目要解决的问题就是计算机视觉领域中的“图像识别”问题，具体来说就是训练计算机识别图片中是猫还是狗。这一问题已经有了很多成熟的解决方案。近几年的研究成果提出了很多以卷积神经网络为核心的图像识别解决方案，例如：

1. [VGGNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)
2. [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
3. [Inception v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567)
4. [Xception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)

我本人之所以选择这个项目，是因为自己对深度学习中计算机视觉这个细分领域很感兴趣，希望自己能够掌握这个领域的理论基础，培养工程实践能力，将来把图像识别技术应用于自动识别害虫，为农作物病虫害防治提供智能化解决方案。

### 问题描述
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### 数据集
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

In this section, the dataset(s) and/or input(s) being considered for the project should be thoroughly described, such as how they relate to the problem and why they should be used. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

### 解决方案描述
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### 基准测试模型
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### 评价指标
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### 项目设计
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.

**Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself. . .**

- Does the proposal you have written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?
- Is each section (particularly **Solution Statement** and **Project Design**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?
- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your proposal?
- Have you properly proofread your proposal to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?
- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?
